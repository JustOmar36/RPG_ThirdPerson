# AC Clone Third Person
This is my first project in Unreal Engine 5. This game is inspired by the open world version of Assassin's Creed and Elden Ring. 
Assets found in this projects came from Megascan, UE5 Marketplace, Sketchfab and Freesound.

This is a playground version of the game. Any 3D models and Landscapes were unable to be uploaded to GitHub due to their size.
